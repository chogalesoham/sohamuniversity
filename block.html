            The hype about big data may have peaked several years ago, but big
            data is far from gone. Instead it forms the foundation for some of
            today’s most exciting technologies. Artificial intelligence (AI),
            machine learning, and data science rely on big data, or data that—by
            virtue of its velocity, volume, or variety—can’t be easily stored or
            analyzed with traditional methods. In this nontechnical course,
            Barton Poulson digs into the topic of big data, explaining how it
            works and shapes our modern data universe. Barton explains big datas
            relationship to AI, data science, social media, and the Internet of
            Things (IoT). He goes over some of the ethical issues behind the use
            of big data. Plus, he covers techniques involved in analyzing big
            data, including data mining and predictive analytics.

            On its own, Tableau is a powerful tool that helps professionals
            analyze, display, and generally make sense of the data at their
            fingertips. With the addition of R—a free, open-source language for
            data science—you can glean even more insights from your data. In
            this course, learn how to combine the analytical strengths of R with
            the visualization power of Tableau to analyze and present data more
            effectively. Instructor Curt Frye demonstrates how to install R and
            RServe; create a connection between Tableau and R; perform several
            types of analyses in R, from linear regression to cluster
            identification; and incorporate those analyses into Tableau
            visualizations.
